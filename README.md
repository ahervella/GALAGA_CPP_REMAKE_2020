# Galaga C++ Remake! - cs4850-project

This was the final project for our Building Game Engines class from the Spring of 2020. The group consisted of myself (Alejandro), Mikey, and Karina. I worked mostly on the game logic, level editor, and rendering portions (as well as making the art!). Feel free to see each of our contributions through our commits!

Below is a demo video of the game play:
