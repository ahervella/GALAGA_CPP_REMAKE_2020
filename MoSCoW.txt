Proposal: Our game is a Galaga-like game in which a player contols a spaceship and shoots at enemies that are also shooting at the player.

Must Have:
- Player-controllable ship that moves left and right and can shoot bullets
- Enemies that appear from the top of the screen and can be shot by the player’s bullets and can also shoot the player and take their lives away
- Win condition: wiping out all enemies of level
- Lose condition: losing all lives

Should Have:
- Life counter in bottom left
- Stats up top (1UP, High Score, 2UP)
- Distinct enemy patterns (e.g. one ship spins clockwise before approaching its position) (Karina’s extension)

Could Have:
- Animated sprites for blown up ships
- Scrolling background (or static)
- Power-ups for different kinds of blasters
- Multiplayer

Won’t Have:
- Ship abduction mechanics: in galaga, your ship can be captured and used against you, but then can be captured back as a second wingman fighter.
- Enemies are more aggressive as the levels progress (but can grow in quantity).
